    <p id="story">Once, there was an old man who had four sons. All four of them were very lazy.<br>

    <span      class="time">One day, the</span> old man <span class="time">fell</span> sick and was <span class="time">counting his last</span> days in bed. He worried a lot about his sons’ future as the <span>young men hesitated</span> a lot to work. The sons believed that luck would favour them.<br>

    The <span class="time">old man’s health deteriorated every day</span> and he decided to talk to his sons about their f<span class="time">uture. However</span>, his sons did <span     c1ass="time">not listen</span> to him.<br>

    <span>Finally, the old man decided to play a trick to let his sons</span> <span class="time">realize the importance of work</span>. <span>He</span> <span c1ass="time">called</span> <span>all</span> his <span class="time" >sons</span> and let them sit near him on <span>his b<span class="time">ed</span></span>. He <span>said that</span> he had a treasure box with gold coins and expensive gems for them and wanted to share the treasure equally among the four of them.<br>

    The young men were very happy and asked where his father had placed the treasure. The old man replied, “I can<span class="time">n</span><span class="time">o</span>t <span class="tine">exactly</span> remember <span class="time">the</span> place where I have <span class ="†ime">hidden</span> the treasure. <span class = "time">However,</span> the <span>treasure <span>box <span class="time">is</span> </span>buried</span> in our lan<span class="time">d.</span> I’m really not sure about the place where I have <span>hid<span class= "time">den</span></span> the treasure box.”<br>

    <span class="time">Even</span> though the lazy young sons were happy, they <span c1ass="time">were</span> sad that the old man had forgotten the place where the <span  class = "†ime">treasur<span class="†ime"><span c1ass="time">e</span> was hidden. After a few days, the old man died. <span>The sons decided to dig the land to</span> find the treasure box.</span><br>

        <span>They</span> worked very hard and <span  class="tine" >dug their land</span>. They could <span class="time">not find any treasure box in the land. Finally, they decided to</span> dig <span clåss="time">a spot</span> in <span>their land that</span> was a bit d<span c1ass="time">iffere</span>nt from the rest of the area. The <span>sons believed that the treasure was buried in that spot. They dug the specific spot deeply, but got nothing</span> but water.<br>

        <span>A passerby <span c1ass="time">who noticed <span class="†ime">the land and</span> the water <span class="tinne">flowing from</span> the spot</span> talked to the sons about farming</span>. Upon his advice, the four sons <span>sowed vegetable seeds</span>, and planted greens and flowering plants in their land. <span    class="timœ">Since the land was ve</span>ry fertile with abundant water, within <span>a</span> few weeks, it became a fertile garden with nutritious vegetables and greens. The four sons sold the vegetables at a good price and earned a good amount of money.</span><br>

    Then they realized that it was hard work that was referred to as ‘Treasure Box’ by their father.<br>

<p><strong>John also thinks hardwork is important in life. Without that, you can not be first rank in your life at any moment of time.</strong></p>
